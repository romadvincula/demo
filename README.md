# Demo
Demo of some projects from tutorials, personal interest, courses, hobbies, etc. I've been working on:

- An obligatory [Hello World](https://romadvincula.github.io/demo/hello/).
- My solution for CS50's [homepage](https://romadvincula.github.io/demo/cs50/homepage/) problem set.
- A guess the [color game](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) from The Web Developer Bootcamp in Udemy that's hopefully implemented right. 


Hosted from [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
